# oc_movies

## Purpose

OC_MOVIES is a frontend application used to interact with OC_MOVIES_API. The application fetches movies from the api and displays them in the browser.

## Requirements

The third party API is necessary for the application to run as intended. The project is available @ https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/OCMovies-API-EN-FR.
You will need the package installer [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) to install dependencies and [virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/#description) if you want to create an isolated environment for the API.

## Installation

You will first need to clone the API repo. Then run from inside the downloaded directory `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
Finally to start the API server, run the command `source env/bin/activate && python manage.py runserver`

## Usage

To start the app, the API server needs to be started first and then just launch the index.html file in your favourite browser.
